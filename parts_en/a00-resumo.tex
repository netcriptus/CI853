Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are often neglected for they only cause an interruption of the normal functioning of the available resources. However, when it come to e-commerce applications, a pause in the services may represent large financial loss. With the advent of the Internet of the Future and architectures like Cloud Computing, mitigating this kind of attack giving more resources to the applications has become a feasible alternative, but entails the Economic DDoS problem. This article presents a mechanism to mitigate DDoS attacks against a Cloud hosted application. Such mechanism is based on the idea of instantiating a replica of the application - simple operation for a Cloud - and redirecting only authentic queries to this replica. The mechanism is innovator because there is no need to identify the attackers and, even so, get to filter only authentic traffic, without the extra overhead and potential categorization errors that could be introduced when trying to identify the clients.
